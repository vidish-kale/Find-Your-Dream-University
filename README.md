In this project we have implemented data cleaning, data scraping and database normalization. Database normalization is a method of organizing the structure of database. This entails building tables and establishing the relationship between these tables in accordance with the principles to protect the data and make the database more flexible by eliminating data redundancy and inconsistent dependency. We then created Views on student and University admission dataset.
